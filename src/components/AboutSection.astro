      <p>
        Hello! I'm a passionate business professional with extensive experience in the sports trading industry. 
        I specialize in strategic management and business development with a 
        focus on creating successful partnerships and driving company growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey in sports business began after completing my engineering studies, where I discovered 
        my passion for the business side of sports. Since then, I've worked with various companies 
        to expand their market presence and optimize their operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not working, you can find me watching sports events, participating in outdoor activities, 
        or exploring new business opportunities in the sports industry.
